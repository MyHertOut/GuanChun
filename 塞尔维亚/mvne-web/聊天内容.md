Hey team :
Since the GitHub repo has moved, and we’ve also replaced the old dev branch with a new main branch that has a rewritten history.
Because of this, you’ll need to reset your local repository to avoid conflicts.

Step 1 — Run This Script
I have written this bash script that will do the git config migration automatically for you. Make sure you are in the repo folder (any branch) and run this command:
bash <(curl -sSL https://gist.githubusercontent.com/pajcho/245cd6826e3fd200c69b07e42b1e3d4c/raw/ee0ad4c35b4be3a853acf5a060e7a7daaecc9449/migrate-to-main.sh)
This will:
Delete local main and dev branches if they exist
Update the Git remote to the new URL (git@github.com:lotusflare/mtn-web.git or https://github.com/lotusflare/mtn-web.git, depending on your setup)
Check out a fresh copy of the new main branch
Let me know if there are any issues, I have tested this myself and it worked as expected

Step 2 — Recreate Your Feature Branches One By One
Create a new branch from main:
git checkout -b your-feature-branch
Cherry-pick your changes from your old branch:
git log backup-branch-name     # find commit IDs
git cherry-pick <commit-id>    # repeat for each relevant commit

Tip: If needed, you can create a backup of your current branch before starting:
git checkout your-branch
git branch backup-your-branch

Do NOT:
Push old branches based on the previous dev or main
Merge or rebase from the old dev — history is not compatible
